### Meeting Goals:
* Add side panels
* Drive code and swerve mechanism test
* Add knockoff mechanism

### Side Panels
A pair of plates were added, one to each side, to protect the electronics panels inside the robot frame. The side panels are hinged with zip ties at the front, and secured at the back with a single bolt. 
This allows them to be quickly rotated out of the way for repair work, and to replace both NXT and Tetrix rechargable battery packs.

### Drive Code
The first test of the drive showed the swerve to be slow, and laggy in response to commands. However, we realized that we had been testing with a dead battery, and mobility was vastly improved with a freshly-charged one. The swerve modules held up well to the test, although the set screws inside showed a tendency to come loose.

### Knockoff Mechanism
Our initial concept called for a simple design to shove the rings off the dispenser racks onto the ground so the robot can move them all at once. We designed and attached two different concepts, one made with legos and an NXT motor, and the other ABS plastic powered by a single servo. During tests, the servo/ABS mechanism proved far superior, both in ease of use, and strength.
