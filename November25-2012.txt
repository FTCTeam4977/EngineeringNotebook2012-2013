### Meeting Goals:
* Finish "Wing" arms
* Epoxy swerve components
* Drive code calibration


### "Wing" arms
Black ABS plates were added to each side of the robot, mounted to servo arms to provide a method of gathering and transporting the rings that are knocked off the dispenser. 

### Epoxy
While the swerve modules themselves are able to withstand the drive forces, the set screws vibrate loose. We corrected the problem with epoxy, as locktite was deemed insufficient for our needs.

### Calibrate Drive
Drive calibration was forcibly delayed until late in the day, due to the dry time on the epoxy. Tuning the PID loops to account for the slop in the chains went fairly quickly, and we ended the meeting with a driveable robot.
