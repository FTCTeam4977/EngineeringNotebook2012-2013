### Meeting Goals:
* Order needed components for lift and claw
* Design brackets for lift
* Test-assemble claw with waterjet plates
* Website work

### Order
We ordered 7x19 nylon coated steel cable, delrin plastic rods, and delrin sheeting for the lift mechanism. Large OD surgical tubing was ordered to construct the belt for the claw.

### Design lift brackets
The lift requires a series of brackets to hold the pulleys onto the drawer glides. These will be made of 1/8 aluminum plate, cut to size. With the thickness determined, we modeled a basic 
example in Autodesk Inventor, so that we could see how much room we had to construct the pulleys. The pulleys will be lathe-cut delrin rods, with a guide over the top, to hold the wire in the cut notch.

### Test-assemble
We recieved the waterjet-cut plates for the rollerclaw, made from 1/8 inch steel. The accuracy of the waterjet meant that they fit exactly to the tetrix c-channel.

### Website
We worked on our new team website, improving the overall look, and pushing the 2.0 site to the test web adress of dev.team4977.org
