### Frame
The finalized frame design for our 2012-2013 robot is 16" tall, 17" wide, and just 14" long. This will allow us to turn easily in tank mode, and to lock the wheels in place in case of damage to the swerve modules. Each of the modules was tightened down, and had their primary axles replaced with cut steel shafts.
The modules were also brought closer to the center of the frame, reducing their impact on the space that will be needed for the lift and ramp mechanisms. The new spacing allows the chains which connect the modules to the servos to be shortened slightly, and to fit more tightly together.
