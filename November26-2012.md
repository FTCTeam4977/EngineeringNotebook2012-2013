###Meeting Goals:
* Secure swerve modules
* Tune swerve PID

### Securing swerve modules
Each module was secured with lock tide, to prevent them from falling apart while driving.

### Swerve PID tuning
The PID for the Robot was tuned to maxamize its driving ability and insure correct module rotation.
