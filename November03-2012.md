### Meeting Goals:
* Run drivetrain chains
* Construct the lift

### Drivetrain
We decided to simplify our drivetrain by turning the pods in pairs. Idealy, we would turn the front and back wheels in groups, however this is not possible due to the position of the lift. We decided to turn the left and right sides of the drivetrain together. 
This will allow us to drive in crab mode, but will require us to stop to turn. Turning will be acomplished through skid steering.

### Lift
