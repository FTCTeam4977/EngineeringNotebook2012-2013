### Meeting Goals:
* Agree on what the robot should be able to accomplish

### Design Aspects:
* Linear slide concept
* Roller claw at 180 degrees
* Plate/arm used to take all of the rings off of the side
* Only picking rings up off the ground


### Linear slide
The lift is composed of two linear slide segments, with the lift cable being rigged in a "continous" style. This means that each section moves up independently of oneanother.

### Roller Claw
The roller claw is a concept we decided to use after seeing it's success in the 2011 FRC game. The claw arm will be actuated using a winch system, powered by a motor. The roller belting will be powered by a continous rotation servo.
