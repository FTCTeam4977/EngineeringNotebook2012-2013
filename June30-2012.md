### Meeting Goals:
* Work on online lab notebook
* Discuss drivetrain radios
* Build a mount for the prototype swerve module
### LordPS

#### What is LordPS?
LordPS is a system that keeps track of the robot's position on a coordinate plane. The overall idea is that this will allow us to do waypoint driven autonomous programs.

#### How does LordPS work?
Keeping track of the location will be handled on the NXT. The current gyro heading will be handled by a co-processor. The co-processor will likely be based around an ATTiny85 or a similar chip with an ADC. This serves double, because we won't have to reset the gyro in teleop for field-centric swerve. The logic for waypoint driving will look similar to this: modify the coordinate to be realitive to the current position ( meaning, when calculating distance and angle the robot will always be the origin ) then use distance formula to determine error from target and atan(y/x) to determine the robot's heading.
