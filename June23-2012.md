### GitHub

We sent a request to GitHub for a sponsored organization account so we are able to create private repositories.
Here is the request we sent:

>Hi,
>
>I'm a member of FIRST Tech Challenge ( FTC ) Team #4977 ( LANLords ). We are a group of high school students that design, build, and program a 18in x 18in x 18in robot to play a game released by FIRST every year. Last year, we used GitHub for our robot code and our website. This year, we're working on some projects that we would like private repositories for. At a maximum, we would need 5 private repositories.

>Our GitHub organization name is: FTCTeam4977

>Thank you,

GitHub was very generous and quick in their response. They are awesome and provided us with 10 private repositories.

>Hey Andrew,
>
>That sounds so AWESOME! We've setup your organization with 10 private repos and we've also upgraded your personal account for a Micro plan, for free. We really hope you enjoy.
>
>Also, if you know of any other groups or students in your school that would like to get setup with something similar, just have them drop us a line at github.com/edu too!
>
>Have an amazing day!

>Good luck!
>Jared

### LordPS

We where able to get some basic communication between an Arduino and the NXT. The final version will probably end up being a plain ATMega chip or a higher end ATTiny. The communication protocol is similar to serial, as data is transferred one bit at a time, then assembled into a byte. It was found the the communication speed is fairly slow. We tried removing as much delay as we could, but we believe that most of the delay is due to the prototyping board being connected over an i2c bus and needing to wait for instructions from the NXT. We have decided that the co-processor will only provide gyro data to the NXT, from the original idea of having it keep track of position too.
