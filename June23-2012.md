We sent a request to GitHub for a sponsored organization account so we are able to create private repositories.
Here is the request we sent:

>Hi,
>
>I'm a member of FIRST Tech Challenge ( FTC ) Team #4977 ( LANLords ). We are a group of high school students that design, build, and program a 18in x 18in x 18in robot to play a game released by FIRST every year. Last year, we used GitHub for our robot code and our website. This year, we're working on some projects that we would like private repositories for. At a maximum, we would need 5 private repositories.

GitHub was very generous and quick in their response. They provided us with 10 private repositories.

>Hey Andrew,
>
>That sounds so AWESOME! We've setup your organization with 10 private repos and we've also upgraded your personal account for a Micro plan, for free. We really hope you enjoy.
>
>Also, if you know of any other groups or students in your school that would like to get setup with something similar, just have them drop us a line at github.com/edu too!
>
>Have an amazing day!

>Good luck!
