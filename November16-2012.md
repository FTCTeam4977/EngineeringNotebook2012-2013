### Meeting Goals:
* Frame reinforcement
* Final lift installation
* Build the claw

### Frame Reinforcement
Due to the amount of stress the winch will create, the robot frame needed to be reinforced to keep it from flexing. We reinforced the top segment of the lift so that we maintain stability at the top.

###Final Lift Installation
The middle segment of the lift was inserted into the frame.

### Build the Claw
The pulleys for the claw were lathed in aluminum, acryllic, and PVC.
