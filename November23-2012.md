### Meeting Goals:
* Complete the lift
* Test the winch
* Design and install electronics boards
* Install the claw

### Complete The Lift
The final lift segment was installed successfully.

### Test The Winch
Tests of the winch motors revealed that although they could handle the load it was very close to their stall limit. So a third motor was added.

### Design And Install Electronics Boards
We decided to mount the electronics board on the robot vertically. The left side has two motor controllers and one servo controller. The right side has two motor controllers and our custom electronics. The robot was successfully wired and the custom electronics will be installed at the next meeting.

### Install The Claw
The mounting bracket for the claw was reduced in size and mounted into the center segment of the lift. The winch motor for the claw was installed at the top of the center segment and a delrin guide plate was installed and mounted to control the claw cable.
