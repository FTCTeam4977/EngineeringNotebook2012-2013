### Meeting Goals:
* Introduce new LANLords member
* IR beacon testing

### Introduction
We introduced our newest member, Tyler Klufkee, to the rest of the team. He is a sophomore, and was recruited from our Trinity Church demonstration.

### IR beacon
We attached the HiTechnic IR sensor to our 2011 robot, for the purpose of testing. We found that the sensor is accurate in close proximity, but gets worse as distance increases.
