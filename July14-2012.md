###Meeting Goals:
* Finish swerve module construction
* Work on prototype 

###Module Construction
Construction on the last module was finished allowing for the modules to be powered for the first time today.

###Rotating Issues
After powering all four modules for the first time today we realized that the ratio on the modules needed increased to allow the modules to rotate easier.  Also when the  motors are locked the servos cannot rotate the modules because the module tries to "walk" in a small circle torquing the frame and wasting energy.  The "walk" in the modules is caused because when the rotate with the top bevel gear locked in place it forces the second bevel to rotate causing the wheel to turn.  This can easily be fixed in software by removing the auto brake on the motors putting them in essentially "neutral" allowing the top bevel gear to spin with the module.
