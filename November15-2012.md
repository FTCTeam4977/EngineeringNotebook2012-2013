### Meeting Goals:
* Constructing lift and winch
* Drivetrain steering chain modification

### Lift and Winch
We've soldered knots into the steel cable to make a cascade lift. And we also reinforced the winch to prevent it from bending under immense pressure. We then measured the amount of force it takes to raise the lift which was 20 lbs. Then we measured the amount of force the winch is capable of outputting, which was 60 lbs.

### Drivetrain steering chain modification
In order to be able to run the steering chains for the drive modules, we had to cut small holes in some of the frame C-channel. After some exparimenting, we found that the slack in the chain could droop into sharp points left over from cutting and lock. We enlarged the holes in the channel, and took more care to reduce catch points for the chain.
