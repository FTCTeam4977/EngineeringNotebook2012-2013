### Meeting Goals:
* Constructing lift and winch
* Enlarge chain holes

### Lift and Winch
We've soldered knots into the steel cable to make a cascade lift. And we also reinforced the winch to prevent it from bending under immense pressure. We then measured the amount of force it takes to raise the lift which was 20 lbs. Then we measured the amount of force the winch is capable of outputting, which was 60 lbs.

### Chain Holes
The chain was catching on the c channel it was passing through, so we enlarged the hole that it was passing through.
