### Meeting Goals:
* Construct a test linear side

### Linear Slide
We assmembled a test multi-layer slide, sandwiching a bar of tetrix metal between two slides to provide a replica of the final pulley bracing. This was repeated again, creating a series of layers in the following pattern: slide-metal-slide-metal-slide. This allows all three slides to extend to their maximum height, which is required to lift the rings to the full height.
