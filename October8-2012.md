### Meeting Goals:
* Assist M\*A\*S\*H with camera and coding for FRC
* Design brackets for lift
* Order swerve upgrade components
* Design LED circuitry

### MASH
We assisted M\*A\*S\*H with  connecting their camera to their robot, and ramping their motor controllers to reduce the jerk when they accelerate suddenly.

### Design lift brackets
The final design for the metal lift brackets was completed, with a top and bottom bracket to fit the respective hole patterns on the glides.

### Order
We ordered steel 5mm axles to replace the standard tetrix alloy axles on the swerve, since the steel will withstand the large stresses much better than the alloy. It also allows us to drill out the axle to create a point for the set screw to achor into.

### Design LED circuitry
We worked on creating a circuit that would allow us to control a series of LED strips from the prototyping board, while powering them with main battery power. This must be done to signal the operator when the robot possesses a heavy ring, 
and the isolation between board and power is required by the rules.
