### Meeting Goals:
* Build additional modules (If parts come)
* Work on Inventor model of drivetrain
* Decide what type of potentiometer to buy

### CAD Model of drivetrain

### Potentiometer:
Here is a list of the possible options that we considered:
* USDigital MA3 - Magnetic absolute encoder, infinite rotation, little to no deadband at rollover point - $40
* 10 turn pot - limited rotation to 10 rotations, absolute - $14
