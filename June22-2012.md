### Meeting Goals:
* Create a bill of materials for the swerve modules
* Discuss what swerve configurations are possible

### Swerve Configurations

Multiple swerve configurations are possible depending on how the modules are linked together. 

All swerve modes we would be interested in implementing are as follows:

* Full swerve - the robot is capable of rotating and moving at the same time
* Snake - the robot is able to execute extreme turns due to the front and back modules turning at opposite angles
* Crab - the robot is capable of moving like a crab, but can not rotate
* Turning crab - the robot is capable of moving like a crab and an rotate, but not at the same time. 

The distribution of motors and chain linkages determine what modes are possible on a drivetrain. This is a list of what is possible with each configuration. 

* Independent drive and steering - everything
* Steering linked diagonal - turning crab
* all steering chained - crab
* left and right steering chained - crab,snake

We plan on implementing a fully independent swerve, however we may fall back to a turning crab if we run out of motors in our final design. We also determined that coaxel swerve would be the best choice to implement for smooth driving.
